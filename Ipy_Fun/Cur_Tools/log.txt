Deaths from childbirth were common in women . and many children did not live past infancy. in addition, most people who did reach old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems. despite this, we do find many examples of pre-20th century individuals attaining life-spans of 75 years or greater, including benjamin franklin, thomas Jefferson, and john adams. this was also true for poorer people like peasants or laborers.

Powerpoint is a wonderful tool for learning in both a student and teacher-directed situation. it can add a new dimension to learning, allowing teachers to explain abstract concepts, while accommodating all learning styles Used properly, powerpoint can be one of the most powerful tools for delivering information. employed inappropriately, powerpoint could potentially confuse students and make learning a difficult process. Once you start using powerpoint, don't forget to look back and ask yourself: "Is this making me a better teacher?" technology is a lot of things, but it shouldn't take the place of well-polished traditional methods of teaching and learning.
